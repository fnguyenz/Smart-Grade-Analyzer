"""
Smart Grade Analyzer Project
This is my first project as a Master of Infotech!
This will be used to calculate a students average grade given their scores in a course.
User will be able to input scores between 0-100, and can let the code know when they are done to begin calculations.
"""
# import extensions (eg. regex)


# define variables



# greet user, ask for the number of courses they'd like to calculate for (or ask them to begin listing their grades)


# save each input into the dictionary or list



# check for any invalid characters using regex, tell them to re-state that grade properly


# once user states they are done listing, calculate the average using the number of courses they inputted into the system
